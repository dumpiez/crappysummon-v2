In this game, You mix up items, and try to win the game!
One more time, sorry for not completing all the previous attempts lol
My target for this version is for it to be a LOT more expansive than the previous one!
(as in, several combinations will open a secret, etc.)

ILL TRY TO MAKE A GUI VERSION I SWEAR-
