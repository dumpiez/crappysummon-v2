In this game, You mix up items, and try to win the game!<br>
One more time, sorry for not completing all the previous attempts lol<br>
My target for this version is for it to be a LOT more expansive than the previous one!<br>
(as in, several combinations will open a secret, etc.)<br>
<br>
ILL TRY TO MAKE A GUI VERSION I SWEAR-
